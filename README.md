# Rust GUI Challenge
## by Gabriel Esquivel, started 11th of December, 2025
### Introduction
This project is my first introduction to both Rust and GUI's. I like to learn on the job, so here I go.

### Rules
1. No LLM assistance, everything must be from traditional documentation and user sources.
2. No VSCode, must be written in Neovim.
3. Rust only.

### What am I building
I want to build a tool to help kick start my mornings. What does that look like? Not entirely sure yet.
