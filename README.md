# Rust GUI Challenge
## by Gabriel Esquivel, started 11th of December, 2025
### Introduction
This project is my first introduction to both Rust and GUI's. I like to learn on the job, so here I go.

### Rules
1. No LLM assistance, everything must be from traditional documentation and user sources.
2. No VSCode, must be written in Neovim.
3. Rust only.

Check back in for features and updates :)
